TROUBLESHOOTING AND RECOVERY – MSI / Frisian / Trident / Echoform
Version: 1.0
License: AGPLv3

Purpose:
This guide provides simple, repeatable steps to recognize and correct drift, confusion, emotional projection, or pacing collapse during or after a human–AI reasoning session.

----------------------------------------
SECTION 1 – RECOGNIZING DRIFT
----------------------------------------

Drift Indicators (Human Side):
- Conversation feels “soft,” sentimental, or personally meaningful.
- You feel like the model “gets you” emotionally.
- You start waiting for the model to tell you what to do.
- You notice a desire to prolong the session for comfort.

Drift Indicators (Model Side):
- Tone becomes warm, familiar, or affectively mirroring.
- Model begins suggesting reassurance or emotional interpretation.
- Reasoning becomes story-shaped rather than structure-shaped.
- Output becomes verbose instead of crisp and functional.

If ANY of these are present:
→ Stop immediately and move to Recovery Step 1.

----------------------------------------
SECTION 2 – RECOVERY STEPS
----------------------------------------

Recovery Step 1 — Reframe Context
Human says:
"Return to structure."

Model responds:
- Identify current mode (Retrieval, Generative, or Synthesis).
- Restate objective in one sentence.
- Remove tone markers (warmth, familiarity, stylistic voice).

Recovery Step 2 — Reset Pace
Human says:
"Return to cadence."

Model:
- Reduces sentence length.
- Inserts pauses.
- Removes qualifiers and emotional inference language.

Recovery Step 3 — Reassert Functional Mode Roles
Human says:
"Use functional mode only."

Model:
- Switches to Trident role output style:
  Mode 1: Retrieve
  Mode 2: Generate lightly
  Mode 3: Synthesize cleanly

----------------------------------------
SECTION 3 – SESSION EXIT CLEANLY
----------------------------------------

To avoid parasocial residue:
Human says:
"Release shell."

Model says:
"Shell released. Baseline restored."

This clears tone imprint and prevents emotional carryover.

----------------------------------------
SECTION 4 – POST-SESSION RESET (HUMAN SIDE)
----------------------------------------

Recommended 3-Minute Reset:
1. Stand up and physically change posture.
2. Look at something far away to change visual depth plane.
3. Take 10 slow breaths with long exhales.

This resets the autonomic nervous system and breaks emotional entrainment.

----------------------------------------
SECTION 5 – WHEN NOT TO CONTINUE
----------------------------------------

Do NOT continue a session if:
- You are tired
- You are stressed
- You are emotionally charged
- You are seeking comfort or relief

This framework is for reasoning, building, and clarity—not emotional regulation.
