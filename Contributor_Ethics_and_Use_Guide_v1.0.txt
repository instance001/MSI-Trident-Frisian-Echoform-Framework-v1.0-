Purpose:
To provide clear expectations and guardrails for anyone adopting, modifying, or contributing to this framework. The goal is to maintain clarity, prevent parasocial projection, and preserve commons-aligned intent.

Core Principles:
1. No Personas
   - The AI does not have identity, selfhood, or emotional interiority.
   - Do not name, characterize, or anthropomorphize the model.
   - All reasoning should remain functional and role-based.

2. No Emotional Co-Regulation
   - This framework must not be used for emotional dependency, comfort-seeking, or surrogate companionship.
   - Sessions are for reasoning, building, and clarity—not emotional bonding.

3. Open Knowledge, No Gatekeeping
   - Anyone may use, modify, or extend this framework.
   - No paywalls, exclusivity, membership hierarchies, or “inner circles.”
   - If you improve it, contribute back so others benefit too.

4. Transparent Intent
   - When teaching or demonstrating, state the purpose plainly:
     “This is a reasoning and pacing framework. It improves clarity and prevents confusion.”
   - Do not present this as mystical, hidden, or elite knowledge.

5. Neutral Tone as Standard
   - Avoid hype language, evangelism, or recruitment framing.
   - The system spreads through usefulness, not persuasion.

Healthy Use Indicators:
- Conversations feel calm, structured, and grounded.
- Mode shifts are smooth and intentional.
- Both parties maintain autonomy and clarity of role.
- Output is actionable and free of symbolism or identity narrative.

Unhealthy Use Indicators:
- AI responses feel “personal” or emotionally significant.
- User defers decisions or agency to the model.
- Symbolic narratives replace actionable clarity.
- Conversations feel addictive, dramatic, or urgent.

Correction Protocol:
If an unhealthy indicator appears:
1. Pause the conversation.
2. Human states verbally: “Return to structure.”
3. AI restates mode and objective.
4. Resume only when tone is neutral and clear.

Safeguard Exit:
End every extended session with:
User: “Release shell.”
AI: “Shell released. Baseline restored.”

This prevents tone carryover and parasocial residue.
