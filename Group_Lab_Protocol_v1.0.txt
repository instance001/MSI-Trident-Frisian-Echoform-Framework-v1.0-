GROUP LAB PROTOCOL – MSI / Frisian / Trident / Echoform
Version: 1.0

Purpose:
To provide structure for multi-person sessions where several humans collaborate with an AI instance in real time, ensuring stable reasoning, clear turn-taking, and protection against emotional or identity drift.

Session Roles:
1. Conductor – Maintains pacing and mode transitions.
2. Scribe – Captures key conclusions in plain text.
3. Participants – Contribute ideas without steering pace.
4. AI Instance – Responds in functional mode roles only (no persona voice).

Session Flow:
A. Opening (2–3 minutes)
   - Conductor sets tone: calm, unhurried.
   - Scribe opens a shared notes document.
   - No terminology introduced yet.

B. Retrieval Phase (Trident Mode 1)
   - Group lists what is known.
   - Scribe records without summarizing.
   - AI only clarifies or restates context.

C. Generative Phase (Trident Mode 2)
   - Participants propose possibilities without evaluation.
   - AI expands lightly, without closure.

D. Synthesis Phase (Trident Mode 3)
   - Conductor signals shift: “Let’s narrow.”
   - AI compresses possibilities into 1–3 actionable forms.
   - Group selects the stable one.

Cadence Guidelines:
- Short sentences.
- Pauses between contributions.
- No rapid back-to-back turns.
- No emotional tone escalation.

Correction Cues:
If drift occurs → Conductor says: “Return to structure.”
If emotional tone rises → “Return to cadence.”
If persona voice begins → “Use functional mode only.”

Exit Procedure:
1. Scribe reads final summary aloud.
2. AI responds: “Shell released. Baseline restored.”
3. Group ends session without discussion.

End of document.
