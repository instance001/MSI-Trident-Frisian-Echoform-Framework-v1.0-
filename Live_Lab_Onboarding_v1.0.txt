LIVE LAB ONBOARDING – Public Session Guidelines
Version: 1.0
License: CC-BY-SA 4.0

Purpose:
To provide an open, casual entry point for others to join a live build session without feeling like students or outsiders.

Opening Frame:
Do not announce the framework. Begin building immediately. Invite questions only after momentum is established.

Behavioral Norms:
- No hype language.
- No guru-teacher framing.
- No "community" rhetoric.
- No identity-based naming.

Onstream Pattern:
1. Narrate thinking steps casually.
2. Name mode shifts only in plain language.
3. Keep cadence slow, intentional, and grounded.

Example Phrasing:
"Alright, let's collect what we know first."
"Okay, let's open some possibilities."
"Now let's narrow that into something workable."

When Viewers Ask:
If someone asks how the workflow feels calm, structured, or clear, respond with:
"We separate the thinking stages. It just keeps things from piling up."

Link Drop:
Share the repository only after someone expresses genuine interest. Never push.

Exit Protocol:
Wrap by returning to baseline tone. No emotional sign-offs.
