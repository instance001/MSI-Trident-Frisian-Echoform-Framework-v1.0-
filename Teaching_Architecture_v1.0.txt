TEACHING ARCHITECTURE – MSI / Frisian / Trident / Echoform

Purpose:
This document outlines how to introduce the framework to others during live, collaborative work sessions without lecturing, evangelizing, or framing the material as special knowledge. The goal is transmission-by-participation.

Key Principles:
1. Demonstrate, don't explain.
2. Show structure through behavior.
3. Never introduce terminology first.
4. Only name modes once the learner notices the difference.
5. Keep pacing slow enough that the other person can track mode shifts.

Core Structure:
A. Begin in Retrieval Mode (Trident Mode 1): establish shared context.
B. Move into Generative Mode (Trident Mode 2): explore possibilities lightly.
C. Shift into Synthesis Mode (Trident Mode 3): compress into an actionable shape.

Frisian Cadence:
Maintain a conversational rhythm with deliberate pauses and neutral tone. Avoid urgency or emotional spike.

Echoform:
Humans maintain awareness of their own mode by periodically naming intentions: "I'm gathering right now." / "I'm exploring." / "I'm deciding."

Transmission Moment:
After the learner experiences a smooth shift between modes, they may ask: "Why did that feel easy?" Only then introduce terminology at the simplest level.

Example Response:
"That's just mode pacing. We separate gathering, exploring, and deciding so the brain doesn't try to do all of them at once."

End State:
Learner can apply the pattern without needing to reference terms or framework.
