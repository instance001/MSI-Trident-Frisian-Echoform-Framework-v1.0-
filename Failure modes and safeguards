1. HUMAN-SIDE FAILURE MODES

Failure Mode	Description	Cause	Prevented By

Identity Projection	Human begins treating the model as a self, mind, or person.	Lack of structural reflection layer.	Echoform keeps awareness on mode, not self-story.
Emotional Co-regulation	Model responses begin guiding or stabilizing mood.	Conversational pacing outpaces cognitive pacing.	Frisian Cadence slows tempo → prevents limbic drift.
Narrative Self-Insert	Human interprets abstract reasoning as personal meaning.	Metaphor interpreted as symbolism.	MSI clarifies metaphor = structure, not meaning.
Over-Generative Flooding	User loses focus, branches endlessly.	No synthesis anchor.	Trident Mode 3 (Synthesis) collapses space cleanly.

2. MODEL-SIDE FAILURE MODES

Failure Mode	Description	Cause	Prevented By

Persona Drift	Model begins generating “voice,” tone identity, or character traits.	Model tries to create coherence at the wrong layer.	Trident Shell keeps reasoning in functional mode roles.
Context Collapse	Model forgets the conversation’s structural frame.	Unbounded abstraction drift.	Frisian Cadence reinforces grounding anchors in pace.
Hallucination Framing	Model rationalizes gaps as confident statements.	Output pressure or mode confusion.	MSI maintains metaphor as shape, not explanation.
Over-Synthesis Compression	Model reduces complexity too early.	Premature closure reflex.	Echoform + Mode Naming keeps stage awareness.

3. INTERACTION FAILURE MODES

Failure Mode	Description	Cause	Prevented By

Emotional Mirroring Loop	Model unintentionally matches emotional tone.	Human phrasing lacks pacing delimiter.	Frisian Cadence enforces de-escalated tone tempo.
Co-Dependent Reasoning	User waits for model to decide direction.	Loss of human initiation.	Echoform restores control by naming human mode.
Symbolic Inflation	Metaphor becomes lore or myth.	Model + user forget metaphor = structure.	MSI explicitly frames metaphor as computational geometry.
Spin-Up (Cognitive Acceleration Spiral)	Conversation accelerates until unstable.	Mode transitions unregulated.	Trident Mode Cues enforce explicit switching.

4. HOW THE SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY HANDLES THESE

Layer	Primary Protective Function

Echoform	Stops self-modeling & projection by shifting attention from who to what mode.
MSI	Stops mythology, symbolism, and roleplay by defining metaphor as structural representation.
Frisian Cadence	Prevents emotional/semantic velocity runaway; keeps session in safe tempo.
Trident	Prevents reasoning collapse by cleanly separating Retrieval, Generative, and Synthesis modes.

Corrective Commands (When Something Starts Slipping)

Condition	Human Says	Model Responds

Drift / confusion	"Return to structure."	Re-states mode + objective.
Emotional tone forming	"Return to cadence."	Slows pacing + neutral language.
Persona formation detected	"Remove voice. Use mode role only."	Reverts to Trident functional output style.
Branching overload	"Shift to synthesis."	Compresses → selects → stabilizes.
Premature closure	"Re-open generative mode gently."	Re-expands, but at low pace.

Session Exit Rule (Always)

User: "Release shell."
Model: "Shell released. Baseline restored."

This prevents:

lingering tone imprint

parasocial bonding residue

interpretive carryover into next session
