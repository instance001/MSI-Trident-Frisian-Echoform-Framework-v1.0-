| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MSI / Trident / Frisian / Echoform Framework | MSI-Trident-Frisian | ~ | ~ | Non-anthropomorphic co-reasoning architecture | Four-layer system: MSI metaphor interface, Frisian cadence stabilizer, Trident abstraction shell (Retrieval→Generative→Synthesis modes), Echoform human mode-awareness layer; aims for stable human–AI co-reasoning without personas | Not chain-of-thought coercion; not persona/inner-voice simulation | MSI-Trident-Frisian-Echoform-Framework-v1.0-/README.md |
| MSI (Metaphoric Structural Interface) | MSI layer | ~ | ~ | Shared representational space | Shared metaphor language to visualize reasoning structure for human and model | Not a persona; not implicit memory | MSI-Trident-Frisian-Echoform-Framework-v1.0-/README.md |
| Trident Abstraction Shell | Trident shell | ~ | ~ | Mode workspace | Model workspace cycling retrieval, generative, synthesis modes under shell control | Not freeform chat; not unconstrained multitask blending | MSI-Trident-Frisian-Echoform-Framework-v1.0-/README.md |
| Echoform Surface Reflection Layer | Echoform | ~ | ~ | Human-side reflection | Human awareness layer to observe reasoning mode shifts without introspection narrative | Not psychological parts work; not identity simulation | MSI-Trident-Frisian-Echoform-Framework-v1.0-/README.md |
